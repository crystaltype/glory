Glory is a modern sans serif font. The rounded corners of the familyâ€™s characters give it a soft, contemporary feel. While the characters are slightly condensed, this semi mono-weight sans features some forms with subtly curved vertical strokes.

Glory was created with graphic design in mind. Create logos, headlines and body text with the six weights that are available. Combine Glory with other script styles to give your work warmth and contrast. For a truly professional look, team up Glory with its script companion, Hurricane.

Glory comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
